function [lb,ub] = RHS(t,y,INFO)

% This subroutine updates the upper and lower bounds for the fluxes in the
% exID arrays in main. The output should be two matrices, lb and ub. The lb matrix
% contains the lower bounds for exID{i} in the ith row in the same order as
% exID. The same is true for the upper bounds in the ub matrix.
% Infinity can be used for unconstrained variables, however, it should be 
% fixed for all time.
